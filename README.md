Street Paws Foundation - Website

Welcome to the Street Paws Foundation website! We are a non-profit organization based in Santa Marta, Colombia, dedicated to ending the suffering of abandoned companion animals. Our mission is to rescue, sterilize, and find loving homes for street dogs and cats. Additionally, we focus on prevention and education to help break the cycle of neglect, abuse, and abandonment.
