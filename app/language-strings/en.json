  "about-us-content": "Since 2011, we've been on a mission in Santa Marta, Colombia, to end the suffering of companion animals. We rescue, sterilize, and find loving homes for street dogs and cats. But our true focus is prevention. Companion animals feel just like we do â€” they experience love and pain. Our goal is to educate the community about their needs, so we can break the cycle of neglect, abuse, and abandonment. Together with our dedicated donors and volunteers, we can make a real difference. Be a part of our mission. Help us today."
